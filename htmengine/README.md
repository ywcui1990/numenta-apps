Numenta HTM Engine
==================

`htmengine` is a python package that comprises a set of long-running services, upon which a scalable, real-time, and production-ready scalar anomaly detection application may be built.  The ideal use-case for `htmengine` is a scenario where there is a continuous stream of data for many metrics, each with a relatively low sample rate e.g. 5-minute intervals.

Tutorial Application
--------------------

An [example application of HTM Engine](https://github.com/nupic-community/htmengine-traffic-tutorial) is available with an [accompanying screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzJd_a6y6-E).

Installation
------------

First, install [`nta.utils`](../nta.utils).  Then, to install `htmengine`:

    python setup.py develop [OPTIONS]

- See `python setup.py develop --help` for options that may be helpful for your specific environment.

### Requirements

- [rabbitmq](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) 3.5 (or higher)
- [mysql](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 5.6 (or higher)

Usage
-----

In order to use `htmengine`, there are some additional steps you MUST do to create a fully functional application.  The below instructions include the details for scaffolding an application for use with `htmengine`.  For a TL;DR version and concrete example in which the following has been done for you, see https://github.com/nupic-community/skeleton-htmengine-app for a simple, fully-functional application upon which you may base your own.

### Configuration

Create a `conf/` directory, and use the following files as templates for your own configuration.  Carefully review each file, and fill in or replace any values that are specific to your application.

- `conf/application.conf`

  Replace `APPLICATION_NAME` in the template below with the name of your application.  Add database credentials in the `[repository]` section with values that match your own MySQL database.

  ```
  [debugging]
  # Controls whether to log performance profiling information: true or false
  profiling = false

  # MySQL database connection parameters
  [repository]
  db =
  host =
  user =
  passwd =
  port =

  [metric_streamer]
  # Exchange to push model results
  results_exchange_name = APPLICATION_NAME.model.results
  # Max records per batch to stream to model
  chunk_size = 1440

  [metric_collector]
  # How often to poll metrics for data in seconds
  poll_interval = 60
  # Metric error grace period seconds after which the metric will be promoted to
  # ERROR state if it continues to encounter errors
  metric_error_grace_period = 10800

  [metric_listener]
  # Port to listen on for plaintext protocol messages
  plaintext_port = 2003
  queue_name = APPLICATION_NAME.metric.custom.data

  [anomaly_likelihood]
  # Minimal sample size for statistic calculation
  statistics_min_sample_size=100
  # How often to refresh the anomaly statistics in rows
  # We refresh once every two hours (ideally we would do this every record)
  statistics_refresh_rate=24
  # Sample size to be used for the statistic calculation
  # We keep a max of one month of history (assumes 5 min metric period)
  statistics_sample_size=8640
  ```

- `conf/model-checkpoint.conf`

  Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/ON/LOCAL/FILESYSTEM/model_checkpoints` with the absolute path to a location where you will store model checkpoints created by `htmengine`.

  ```
  # Model Checkpoint Manager Configuration

  [storage]
  # The root directory of the model checkpoint archive.
  # May use environment variables; MUST expand to absolute path
  root = /ABSOLUTE/PATH/ON/LOCAL/FILESYSTEM/model_checkpoints
  ```

- `conf/model-swapper.conf`

  Replace `APPLICATION_NAME` with the name of your application in the template below.

  ```
  # Model Swapper Configuration

  [debugging]
  # Controls whether to log performance profiling information: true or false
  profiling = false


  # Model Swapper Interface Bus
  [interface_bus]

  # Name of the queue for model command and inference results
  results_queue = APPLICATION_NAME.mswapper.results

  # A model's input queue name is the concatenation of this prefix and model id
  model_input_queue_prefix = APPLICATION_NAME.mswapper.model.input.

  # Name of the Model Scheduler notification queue
  scheduler_notification_queue = APPLICATION_NAME.mswapper.scheduler.notification


  [model_runner]
  # The target number of model input request objects to be processed per
  # checkpoint. This may span multiple batches, until the number of requests
  # reaches or exceeds this value. Since it always processes all requests in a
  # batch, the actual number of requests processed before checkpointing the model
  # may be higher than this number.
  target_requests_per_checkpoint = 500
  ```

- `conf/supervisord.conf`

  Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/THIS/APPLICATION/conf` in the template below to the location of the application `conf/` directory containing the files you just created.  Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/htmengine` with the absolute path to the htmengine source.

  ```
  ; Sample supervisor config file.
  ;
  ; For more information on the config file, please see:
  ; http://supervisord.org/configuration.html
  ;
  ; Note: shell expansion ("~" or "$HOME") is not supported.  Environment
  ; variables can be expanded using this syntax: "%(ENV_HOME)s".

  [unix_http_server]
  file=%(here)s/../supervisor.sock   ; (the path to the socket file)

  [inet_http_server]
  port=127.0.0.1:9001

  [supervisord]
  environment=APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH=/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/THIS/APPLICATION/conf
  pidfile=%(here)s/../supervisord.pid
  identifier=APPLICATION_NAME-supervisor
  logfile=%(here)s/../logs/supervisord.log
  # NOTE: logfile_maxbytes=0 turns off supervisor log rotation
  logfile_maxbytes=50MB
  logfile_backups=10
  loglevel=info
  nodaemon=false
  minfds=1024
  minprocs=200

  [rpcinterface:supervisor]
  supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

  [supervisorctl]
  serverurl=http://:


  [include]
  files = /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/htmengine/conf/supervisord-base.conf
  ```

In your own environment, you MUST set the `APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the absolute path to the application config path.  This must match the value in `conf/supervisord.conf`!

### Repository

`htmengine` uses MySQL to cache data locally at various stages of processing and has a very specific schema (included below) that it requires to be implemented:

```
CREATE TABLE instance_status_history (
    server VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
    status VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (server, timestamp)
);

CREATE TABLE `lock` (
    name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (name)
);

INSERT INTO `lock` (`name`) VALUES('metrics');

CREATE TABLE metric (
    uid VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    datasource VARCHAR(100),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description VARCHAR(200),
    server VARCHAR(100),
    location VARCHAR(200),
    parameters TEXT,
    status INTEGER DEFAULT '0',
    message TEXT,
    collector_error TEXT,
    last_timestamp DATETIME NULL DEFAULT NULL,
    poll_interval INTEGER DEFAULT '60',
    tag_name VARCHAR(200),
    model_params TEXT,
    last_rowid INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (uid)
);

CREATE INDEX datasource_idx ON metric (datasource);

CREATE INDEX location_idx ON metric (location);

CREATE INDEX server_idx ON metric (server);

CREATE TABLE metric_data (
    uid VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
    rowid INTEGER DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
    metric_value DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    raw_anomaly_score DOUBLE,
    anomaly_score DOUBLE,
    display_value INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (uid, rowid),
    CONSTRAINT metric_data_to_metric_fk FOREIGN KEY(uid) REFERENCES metric (uid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX anomaly_score_idx ON metric_data (anomaly_score);

CREATE INDEX timestamp_idx ON metric_data (timestamp);
```

### Logs

`htmengine` services write out log data to `logs/` from the base of the application directory.  Create it, if it does not exist.

```
mkdir -p logs
```

Services
--------

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is used to start, and keep running, a set of processes that implement a processing pipeline for incoming scalar data for the purpose of calculating and reporting on [NuPIC Anomaly Scores](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Anomaly-Detection-and-Anomaly-Scores).  [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) brokers messages between these processes.

### Metric Listener

`htmengine.runtime.metric_listener` implements a [Graphite](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#feeding-in-your-data)-compatible API to accept plain-text metric data over a TCP connection on port 2003.  Metric data is accepted in the following format:

```
name value timestamp\n
```

- `name` is the metric name, typically composed of a hierarchical period-delimited path.
- `value` is the metric value, which can be any scalar value
- `timestamp` is the unix timestamp associated with the metric sample.

For example:

```
foo.bar.stats 21 1443197361
```

Multiple metric samples may be sent over a single connection, as long as the above format is used, and metric samples are sent one-per-line.  Metric samples will be processed in the order they are sent, so if you are sending a batch of data at once, be sure to sort it by timestamp!

### Metric Storer

`htmengine.runtime.metric_storer` stores the metric samples in a local MySQL database, and is separate from the Metric Listener so as to not block clients of the API on database I/O.

### Model Scheduler

`htmengine.model_swapper.model_scheduler_service` implements the "Model Swapping" process that allows `htmengine` to scale to hundreds, and possibly even thousands, of NuPIC anomaly models on a single instance.  This works by regularly checkpointing models to disk, and reloading them on-demand.  Incoming samples are buffered until the model can be loaded and as a result, there is a short, but undefined latency associated with the processing of any given metric sample.

### Anomaly Service

`htmengine.runtime.anomaly_service` calculates the final Anomaly Likelihood score and publishes the results to an exchange for later processing by the user-defined application, if necessary.  The results are also saved to the local MySQL database.

API
---

### Sending data

You may also programatticaly send data directly to RabbitMQ, bypassing the Metric Listener TCP service:

```python
import json
from nta.utils import message_bus_connector

msg = json.dumps(dict(protocol="plain", data=["foo.bar.stats 21 1443197361"]))
bus = message_bus_connector.MessageBusConnector()
bus.publish(mqName=MESSAGE_QUEUE_NAME, body=msg, persistent=True)
```

### Creating a model

Inbound data is only cached until a model is specifically created for that metric.  There is an API for monitoring a specific metric:

```python
from htmengine.adapters.datasource import createDatasourceAdapter

modelSpec = {
  "datasource": "custom",
  "metricSpec": {
    "metric": "foo.bar.stats"
  },
  "modelParams": {
    "min": 0,  # optional
    "max": 100  # optional
  }
}

adapter = createDatasourceAdapter(modelSpec["datasource"])
modelId = adapter.monitorMetric(modelSpec)
```

### Post-processing the results

The results are cached in the MySQL database, in the `metric_data` table.  `htmengine` uses [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to access the database, and provides a high-level function to query the data directly from the database.  For example, the following python snippet queries the repository for, and prints metric data:

```python
import calendar
from htmengine import repository
from htmengine.repository import schema
from nta.utils.config import Config

METRIC_NAME = "foo.bar.stats"

appConfig = Config("application.conf", os.environ["APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH"])

with repository.engineFactory(appConfig).connect() as conn:
  metricObj = repository.getCustomMetricByName(conn,
                                               METRIC_NAME,
                                               fields=[schema.metric.c.uid])

  fields = (schema.metric_data.c.metric_value,
            schema.metric_data.c.timestamp,
            schema.metric_data.c.rowid,
            schema.metric_data.c.anomaly_score)
  sort = schema.metric_data.c.timestamp.asc()

  result = repository.getMetricData(conn,
                                    metricId=metricObj.uid,
                                    fields=fields,
                                    sort=sort)

  for row in result:
    print METRIC_NAME,
    print str(row.metric_value),
    print str(calendar.timegm(row.timestamp.timetuple())),
    print str(row.anomaly_score)))
```

### Real-time results

You may also process the results in real-time by creating a queue bound to the results exchange:

```python
import os

from nta.utils import amqp
from nta.utils.config import Config

from htmengine import htmengineerrno
from htmengine.runtime.anomaly_service import AnomalyService



appConfig = Config("application.conf", os.environ["APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH"])

modelResultsExchange = appConfig.get("metric_streamer",
                                     "results_exchange_name")
queueName = "APPLICATION_NAME_results"



def declareExchanges(amqpClient):
  """ Declares model results and non-metric data exchanges
  """
  amqpClient.declareExchange(exchange=modelResultsExchange,
                             exchangeType="fanout",

                                                     metricId,
                                                     metricName)

  if not batch["results"]:
    print "Empty results in model inference results batch; model=%s" % metricId
    return

  print metricId, batch["results"]

Running HTMEngine Integration Tests
-----------------------------------

The HTM engine has a basic skeleton application exclusively for running tests.
To run the tests, you must have MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Supervisor running.

Make sure that `APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH` is set to point to `tests/support/skeleton-app/conf`
For example:
```export APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH=/Users/{name}/nta/numenta-apps/htmengine/tests/support/skeleton-app/conf```
(alternatively you can use the `APPLICATION_CONFIG_PATH` from an app based off
of the HTMEngine, just be careful to not reset an existing MySQL database)

With MySQL already started start/restart RabbitMQ:
`rabbitmq-server -detached`

Setup the htmengine MySQL database:
(don't do this if you're testing on HTM-IT, Taurus, or another HTMEngine application)
`./tests/support/skeleton-app/reset_db.py`

Start `supervisord`:
```cd tests/support/skeleton-app```
```supervisord -c conf/supervisord.conf```
*NOTE: Be sure to run `mkdir logs` within the `skeleton-app` directory so
supervisor has a place to store its logs*

Run the integration tests:
`py.test tests/integration`
