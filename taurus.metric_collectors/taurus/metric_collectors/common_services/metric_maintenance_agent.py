"""This service maintains consistency between the collectors' metrics
configuration and the models as well as the buffered data in metric collectors
repository. It also promotes unmonitored metrics that have reached a certain
metric data quantity threshold to models.

This service relies explicitly on these environment variables:
  TAURUS_HTM_SERVER
  TAURUS_API_KEY

NOTE: the functionality is influenced by the service's opmode (see below), which
is configured via `taurus-collectors-set-opmode`.

Upon start-up: The script checks its opmode and exits with 0 return code if the
service is configured for hot-standby mode.

In active opmode, the service first checks for consistency between metrics
configuration and the stock symbols in the xignite_security table. It then
proceeds to delete metrics/models and xignite_security rows for companies whose
stock symbol is no longer in metrics config.

Then, the service enters a loop where it periodically promotes unmonitored
metrics that have reached a preconfigured metric data quantity threshold to
models.
