## License

Dual Commercial and AGPLv3 License. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)
and http://numenta.org/licenses/.


## Repository

The `js/` directory contains Cross-platform Desktop Application GUI code,
running Javascript/HTML/CSS/etc. on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), and
[Google Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home). It also contains non-GUI logic
to run and manage HTM Models on the Unicorn model runner.

The `py/` directory contains Unicorn ModelRunner and supporting code
(Python / C++), which drives the main functionality of the app, which it is our
goal to demo to the user.

#### Description

The Frontend contains code to manage Models on the Backend. It also contians
the Graphical User Interface that allows users to explore HTM Models on their
own data.

The GUI for this application is web code. `Javascript`, `HTML`, and `CSS` are
loaded into a browser. For Desktop, this browser is a bare-bones Chrome window
opened by the Electron framework. Electron also runs Node.js to connect with the
host Operating System, allowing for cross-platform native controls. Since web
code is notoriously asynchronous, we use `js-csp` to handle a/synchronous
data flow.

In the browser, we run a one-way Uni-directional data flow, an Architecture
known as "Flux".

Below is an example of tracing of our way through GUI initialization, GUI first
loop run, and GUI loop continuation:

1. Electron loads `js/main.js`
1. .. which (or Browser directly) loads `js/browser/index.html`
1. .. which loads `js/browser/js/app.js`
1. .. which inits Fluxible
1. .. and then Fluxible fires off an initial Action
1. .. which dispatches Events with state data to Stores
1. .. which then integrate state data into themselves
1. .. and then View Components tied to updated Stores render
1. .. and then The User interacts with the app firing off a new Action
1. .. GOTO #6, RINSE and REPEAT.

#### Guidelines

* ECMAScript Styleguide: `npm run lint`, Rules: `.eslintrc`
* HTML5 @TODO
* CSS3 @TODO


## Setup

IMPORTANT: These setup instructions are only about if you care about running
the full app with all its components (Electron app with packaged model
runner). If you care about the python only - for example - then change to
`unicorn/py` and follow the README instructions there.

Example of setting up development environment on Mac OS/X:

```shell
brew install git node
git clone https://github.com/numenta/numenta-apps
cd numenta-apps/unicorn
pip install -r py/requirements.txt
npm install
npm run prepare:python # to freeze model_runner.py so that it can be used in Unicorn.
export APPLICATION_LOG_DIR=logs  # to change to model_runner.py param?
```


## Develop

### Desktop App

Important note: when running `npm run desktop` the application will fail to find
`dist/model_runner` if `model_runner.py` was never frozen before. Make sure
to run `npm run prepare:python` beforehand, if any of the following applies:
* The script `model_runner.py` has never been frozen (i.e. neither
  `npm run build` nor `npm run prepare:python` have been run before).
* Changes were made to the the code under `unicon/py`.
* Changes to NuPIC were made.

Start code via Electron as a Desktop App:

```shell
# Freeze the model runner if:
# - It was never frozen before
# - Changes were made to the the code under unicon/py
# - Changes to NuPIC were made.
npm run prepare:python

# desktop dev
npm run desktop
NODE_ENV=development npm run desktop  # same
npm run desktop | `npm bin`/bunyan    # pretty logs

# desktop prod
NODE_ENV=production npm run desktop
```

### Documentation

Frontend code documentation can be generated and viewed by following the
directions below. Comments are in [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) format, with
output generated by [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/).

```shell
# generate documentation
npm run docs

# view documentation (mac os/x)
open js/docs/index.html
```

### Notes

* Lint your code before creating pull requests:
  * `npm run lint`
* Manual access to LevelDB file database from
  [Lev](https://github.com/hij1nx/lev) command-line tool (Mac OS/X):
  * `` `npm bin`/lev $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/unicorn/database/ ``
* Make sure to update packages often, especially after pulling an update into
  your branch:
  * `npm run check`
  * `pip list --outdated`
* Sometimes `node_modules/` directory can become corrupted, try cleaning and
  reinstalling: `npm run clean ; npm run check`
* Remember, this is cross-platform. We need to support all main operating
  systems! Windows has no environment variables, etc. Paths should not be
  defined manually, but use the `path` library helper instead.

## Test

Write **Unit** and **Integration** tests using
[mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) test framework.

```shell
# All tests
npm run test
```

### Unit

```shell
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit
```

### Integration

```shell
# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration
```

### Pipeline

To generate reults appropriate for the **pipeline** `mocha` needs to run
with a different set of options
(see [mocha.pipeline.opts](tests/js/mocha.pipeline.opts)).

```shell
# Pipeline: All tests
npm run test:pipeline

# Pipeline: Unit tests only
npm run test:pipeline:unit

# Pipeline: Integration tests only
npm run test:pipeline:integration
```


## Build

### Mac OS/X

Build the electron app with:

```shell
npm run build
```
The resulting `.app` can be found in `unicorn/Unicorn-darwin-x64/`

### Windows

TODO


## Release

### Signing

* You need a certificate type of “Developer ID Application” from Apple. This certificate usually has a common name in the form of `Developer ID Application: YourCompany, Inc. (ABCDEFGHIJK)`.
* Set the environment variable `UNICORN_CERT_DEV_APPLE` and sign the app:
```
export UNICORN_CERT_DEV_APPLE="Developer ID Application: Numenta, Inc. (ABCDEFGHIJK)"
```
* Now when you package Unicorn with `npm run electron:packager`, the app will be signed.


* Useful blog post about signing Electron apps:

### App Store

* Currently, the instructions to release an Electron app on the app store can
  be found here:
